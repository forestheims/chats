### based on the tibetan book of the dead, what should I focus on daily to be reminded of the white light?

#

In the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the white light is considered a representation of the ultimate reality and is perceived as a sign of liberation. To focus on it daily, cultivate mindfulness and awareness of the present moment. You can also meditate and visualize yourself surrounded by a white light, which represents clarity, purity, and wisdom. One way to do this is to start your day with a simple visualization exercise. Sit quietly in a comfortable, relaxed position, and close your eyes. Breathe deeply and slowly, and imagine a powerful, bright white light radiating from the center of your being, expanding outward to fill your whole body, and then radiating beyond. Focus on the feeling of the light, and allow it to fill you with peace and clarity. Throughout the day, you can also bring your attention back to this visualization whenever you feel yourself becoming distracted or stressed. Simply take a moment to close your eyes, breathe deeply, and visualize the white light surrounding you once again, reminding yourself of the ultimate reality that is always available to you, no matter what external circumstances you may be facing.
