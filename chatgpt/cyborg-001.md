### Would today's humans with a smart phone be considered a cyborg?

#

From a technical perspective, a person with a smartphone could be considered a cyborg to some extent. A cyborg is a being that has both biological and technological parts, and a smartphone is a device that enhances human capabilities by providing access to vast amounts of information and communication tools. However, the extent to which a smartphone can be considered a part of the human organism is debatable, since it is not physically integrated into the human body. Ultimately, the answer depends on how one chooses to define the term "cyborg".
