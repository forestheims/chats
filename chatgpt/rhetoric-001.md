### what is the authors view towards rhetoric, in the book "Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance?

#

The author of "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", Robert Pirsig, has a complex view towards rhetoric. On one hand, he acknowledges the power of language to shape our perceptions, values, and beliefs, and describes it as a kind of "social technology" that can be used to improve communication and understanding between people. On the other hand, he is critical of what he sees as the manipulative and superficial ways in which rhetoric is often employed, especially in fields like advertising and politics. Overall, Pirsig's view towards rhetoric is one of skepticism and caution, recognizing both its potential for good and its capacity for harm.
