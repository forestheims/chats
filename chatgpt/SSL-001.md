### Can you give me some advice on where to look to start debugging an issue I'm having while setting up a nginx reverse proxy? I have nginx setup on an ubuntu server on AWS. It is currently proxying to the correct server/website. The issue is that the URL bar still shows the "not secure" warning, with a red line through the https:// part of the URL. I have hte SSL certificate that I self generated , and the config file is pointing to the corret spot (nginx config). I don't know much about SSL, so I know I have a lot to learn in that area, but don't know where to start

First, you can check if the SSL certificate is properly installed by running the following command in your terminal: `openssl s_client -connect mydomain.com:443` Replace `mydomain.com` with your actual domain name. If the certificate is properly installed, you should see some certificate information. Next, you can check the nginx error and access logs to see if there are any relevant errors or warnings. To do this, run the following command in your terminal: `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log /var/log/nginx/access.log` This will allow you to see any incoming requests and error messages as they happen. If you are still unsure of where to start, I would recommend reading up on SSL and nginx documentation, specifically the ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key directives in the nginx config file. It's important to ensure that your SSL certificate is properly installed and configured before proceeding with any other troubleshooting steps.
