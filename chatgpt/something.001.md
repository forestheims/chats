### can you please explain how the law of attraction as described by you just now is different from a belief in thought forms?

#

The Law of Attraction is often described as the principle that like attracts like. This means that our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs have an energetic frequency that attracts similar energy back into our lives. So, if you focus on positive thoughts and feelings, you'll attract positive experiences and outcomes, and vice versa. On the other hand, the concept of thought forms is based on the idea that our thoughts have a tangible existence and can affect the physical world. It suggests that our thoughts can manifest as energy patterns or entities that can influence people or events around us. While the Law of Attraction focuses on the power of our thoughts and emotions to manifest specific outcomes, the idea of thought forms suggests that our thoughts can have a direct impact on the physical environment. While there may be some overlap between the two concepts, they are ultimately distinct beliefs with different underlying principles.
